# Todo Calendar

A simple, client-side calendar application to manage daily notes or to-do items.

## Features



- **Waterdrop UI Design:** A soft, rounded, and fluid aesthetic for a modern look.

- **Monthly Calendar View:** Navigate through months and see a full monthly calendar.

- **Daily Notes:** Click on any day to add, edit, or delete a note for that day.

- **Persistent Storage:** Notes are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.

- **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed interface.

- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes for personalized viewing.

- **Comprehensive Korean Holidays:** Displays all major Korean public holidays, including lunar-based holidays (Seollal, Chuseok) and substitute holidays, marked in red.

- **Enhanced Lotto Generator:** Always active, generates 5 sets of Lotto numbers (1-45), saves them to the current week's Saturday note, and allows only one generation per week.

- **Responsive:** The calendar is designed to work on different screen sizes.
